# Kegerator Setup

*Disclaimer: I used `nc` as the name of my virtual environment to set up Python packages, but you can use whatever name you choose.

    pip install virtualenv && pip install virtualenvwrapper
    mkvirtualenv nc
    workon nc

    pip install -r requirements.txt

    python main.py

Note: Every time you work on this project, you need to enter the `nc` environment by running `workon nc`.
